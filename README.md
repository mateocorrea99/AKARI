# AKARI

This is an Akari puzzle. It consists of a grid with 3 different types of cells: walls, clues and corridors. Walls are simply black squares that block light. Clues are walls with a number inside, that indicate the number of lamps adjacent (left, right, above, or below) to that wall. Corridors are the cells where you can place lamps and the cells that get lit. The aim of the game is to light up all corridor cells by placing correctly lamps throughout the grid and satisfying all clues. Be careful, you must fulfill the following conditions to win:

####     - All corridor cells must be lit
####      - All clues must be satisfied
####      - A lamp cannot be lit by another lamp
####      - Walls can have any number of adjacent lamps
####      - There is no limit as to how many lamps you can put in the grid

Good luck! :)
